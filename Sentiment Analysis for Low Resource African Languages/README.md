We fine-tuned the AfriBERTa model, a pre-trained large language model, to perform sentiment analysis on Hausa text. In addition to leveraging the NaijaSenti dataset, we curated an extensive corpus of Hausa data for Language-Adaptive Fine-Tuning (LAFT) to enhance the modelâ€™s understanding of the language. This project explores the challenges of low-resource languages and highlights the importance of diverse data representation in NLP tasks.
